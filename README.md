The repository for the final year project 2017

# Project Meeting 2 - 9 Nov 2017

## Litearature Review

### Existing Work
- Needs to be much more **complete** than the litearture review in the project proposal;
- Cover different media: app, website, service, organisation, physical print/product ...
- Focus on the most relevant: help you to narrow down your scope.
- Include academic publications to support your argument: 
  - IEEE Xplore: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp
  - ACM Digital Library: https://dl.acm.org/
- Use Zotero

### Development Technologies

- Be **open** about what form the project prototype will be: app, website, service, organisation, physical print/product ...
- Research different ways of implementation:
  - For example for app development, there is native and hybrid, and then there are many different hybrid frameworks. 
  - Comparison: 
    - Identify required **functions**, such as user regiter/login, database, messaging, image/video, ...
    - Compare different options regarding to the functions: is it possible at all, how easy it is to learn/program, how fast/secure/reliable it is, ...
    - Each person pick **one fuction and compare it across options**.
- Justify your choice

| | User Interface (menu, button, etc.) | User login and registration | Data storage and sharing | instant messaging | API (google maps, facebook, etc.) | Camera, GPS, and other hardware|

## First Iteration

### Requirements

- Find real users or company/organisation/charity that work with real users.
  - Find someone local if possible: much easier for the communication.
- Get the requirements from the real users, not what you think.
- The requirements should be technology independent, in most cases.

### Design/Implement

- Paper prototype/wireframe tool: 
  - Pencil and paper
  - Low fidelity: Balsamiq https://balsamiq.com/
  - High fidelity: Just in mind: https://www.justinmind.com/
  - Share the design: InVision https://www.invisionapp.com/

### Evaluation/Feedback

- Show user the paper prototype/wireframe and get feedback.
- Revise the desgin and project scope accordingly.

# Project Meeting 1 - 26 Oct 2017

## Project proposal
  - Introduction/background
  - The problem + overview/literature review: related software, app, website, and academic publications
  - Your (project) idea
  - Plan
    - 3 iterations: 
      - each iteration has requirements, design, implementation, and evaluation.
      - first iteration: paper prototype
      - second iteration: working prototype with minimal function
      - third iteration: fully working prototype
    - A list of deliverables and deadlines are fine (example below)
    
    | Deadline | Milestone | Deliverable |
    | ---- | --------- | ----------- |
    | Week 5 | Submit project proposal | Project proposal|
    | Week 8 | Complete literature review | Literature review report|
    | Week 11 | Complete first iteration | Paper prototype|
    | Week 12 | Submit interim report | Interim report|
    | Week 16 | Complete second iteration | Working prototype|
    | Week 20 | Complete third iteration | Final prototype|
    | Week 24 | Submit final report | Final report|

    - Software: https://www.zotero.org/

## GitHub.com
Use github.com for project file and code (Kai)
  - 'Code': report and implementation code
  - 'Issues': tasks and coding issue
  - 'Projects': planning and project management
  - 'Wiki': notes, meetings, reports, and any other documentation
  - How to use git: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 (first 2 chapters)

## Code editor (IDE): 
Recommended: Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/. 

Much better for JavaScript development than Brackets (http://brackets.io/), Sublime Text (https://www.sublimetext.com/), or Notepad++ (https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

## Latex
Use Latex instead of Word for all the reports: proposal, progress report, final report, and viva. 
  - why use latex: http://www.andy-roberts.net/writing/latex/benefits
  - tutorial: https://www.latex-tutorial.com/tutorials/
